# Project Name
# SuMoHeal 'Surgery Money Healers' 

I believe that health is one of the most important things in our lives. So, I decide to make an application that helps patients to solve their hospital bill problems and get their good health again. The application allows the user to:
- Create post with his contact details, this feature will help the donor to contact the patient and cheick on him.
- User can create his profile page and add/edit his profile picture
- User can be intrested and unintrested in any post
- Make comments to all posts
- Heal any other user by filling the form which is under each post 
- Follow and unFollow users
- See other users profile page
